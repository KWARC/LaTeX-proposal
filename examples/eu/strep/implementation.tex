\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
  Describe the organizational structure and decision-making mechanisms
  of the project. Show how they are matched to the nature, complexity
  and scale of the project.  Maximum length of this section: five pages.

  If appropriate describe the industrial/commercial involvement to ensure exploitation of
  the results. Show how the opportunity of involving SMEs has been addressed

The project partners of the \pn project have a long history of successful collaboration;
Figure~\ref{tab:collaboration} gives an overview over joint projects (including proposals) and
joint publications (only international, peer reviewed ones).
