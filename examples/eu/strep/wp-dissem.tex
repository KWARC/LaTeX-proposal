\begin{wpobjectives}
  Much of the activity of a project involves small groups of nodes in joint work. This
  work package is set up to ensure their best wide-scale integration, communication, and
  synergetic presentation of the results. Clearly identified means of dissemination of
  work-in-progress as well as final results will serve the effectiveness of work within
  the project and steadily improve the visibility and usage of the emerging semantic
  services.
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}
  The work package members set up events for dissemination of the research and
  work-in-progress results for researchers (workshops and summer schools), and for
  industry (trade fairs). An in-depth evaluation will be undertaken of the response of
  test-users.

  Within two months of the start of the project, a project website will go live. This
  website will have two areas: a members' area and a public area.\ldots
