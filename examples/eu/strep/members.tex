\section{Individual Participants}\label{sec:partners}
\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
For each participant in the proposed project, provide a brief description of the legal entity, the main
tasks they have been attributed, and the previous experience relevant to those tasks. Provide also a
short profile of the individuals who will be undertaking the work.\\
Maximum length for Section 2.2: one page per participant. However, where two or more departments within
an organisation have quite distinct roles within the proposal, one page per department is acceptable.\\
The maximum length applying to a legal entity composed of several members, each of which is a separate
legal entity (for example an EEIG1), is one page per member, provided that the members have quite distinct
roles within the proposal.
