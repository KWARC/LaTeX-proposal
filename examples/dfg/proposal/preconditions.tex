\section{Project Requirements}\label{sec:requirements}

\subsection{Employment Status Information}\label{sec:req:employment-status}

\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
  For each applicant, state the last name, first name, and employment status (including
  duration of contract and funding body, if on a fixed-term contract).
\end{todo}

\subsection{First-time Proposal Data}\label{sec:req:first}

\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
  Only if applicable: Last name, first name of first-time applicant.

  If this is your first proposal, reviewers will consider this fact when assessing your
  proposal. Previous proposals for research fellowships, publication funding, travel
  allowances, or funding for scientific networks are not considered first proposals. If
  you are submitting a “first-time proposal” and it is part of a joint proposal, please
  note that your independent project must be distinct from the other projects.

  If you have already submitted a proposal as an applicant for a research grant and have
  received a letter informing you of the funding decision, or if you have led an
  independent junior research group or project in a Collaborative Research Centre or
  Research Unit, you are no longer eligible to submit a ``first proposal''. If you have
  submitted a ``first-time proposal'' and it was rejected, you may resubmit the
  application, in revised form, as a first-time proposal for the same project.
\end{todo}

\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}

  funding.
